* The Chasing LED system allows the user to control speed of the LEDs as well as pausing the system. This is done by using a mouse.
  * lbtn pauses / resumes the Chasing LED system (stops / unstops it from moving)
  * rbtn allows the user to change the period of the chasing LED (from a 1 to 350 ms delay)
